  PEN IMAGE
        A pen is a common writing instrument that applies ink to a surface, usually paper, for writing or drawing.[1] Early pens such as reed pens, quill pens, dip pens and ruling pens held a small amount of ink on a nib or in a small void or cavity that had to be periodically recharged by dipping the tip of the pen into an inkwell.[2][3] Today, such pens find only a small number of specialized uses, such as in illustration and calligraphy. Reed pens, quill pens and dip pens, which were used for writing, have been replaced by ballpoint pens, rollerball pens, fountain pens and felt or ceramic tip pens.[4] Ruling pens, which were used for technical drawing and cartography, have been replaced by technical pens such as the Rapidograph.[5] All of these modern pens contain internal ink reservoirs, such that they do not need to be dipped in ink while writing.[6]

        PENCIL IMAGE
        A pencil (/ˈpɛnsəl/ ⓘ) is a writing or drawing implement with a solid pigment core in a protective casing that reduces the risk of core breakage and keeps it from marking the user's hand.

        Pencils create marks by physical abrasion, leaving a trail of solid core material that adheres to a sheet of paper or other surface. They are distinct from pens, which dispense liquid or gel ink onto the marked surface.

        Most pencil cores are made of graphite powder mixed with a clay binder. Graphite pencils (traditionally known as "lead pencils") produce grey or black marks that are easily erased, but otherwise resistant to moisture, most solvents, ultraviolet radiation and natural aging. Other types of pencil cores, such as those of charcoal, are mainly used for drawing and sketching. Coloured pencils are sometimes used by teachers or editors to correct submitted texts, but are typically regarded as art supplies, especially those with cores made from wax-based binders that tend to smear when erasers are applied to them. Grease pencils have a softer, oily core that can leave marks on smooth surfaces such as glass or porcelain.

        ERASER IMAGE
        eraser, piece of rubber or other material used to rub out marks made by ink, pencil, or chalk. The modern eraser is usually a mixture of an abrasive such as fine pumice, a rubbery matrix such as synthetic rubber or vinyl, and other ingredients. The mixture is processed and extruded and, if made with rubber, vulcanized to bond the ingredients. In 1752 the Proceedings of the French Academy of Sciences reported a suggestion for using caoutchouc, a vegetable gum produced by certain South American trees, to erase black lead marks. Caoutchouc was named rubber in 1770 by the English chemist Joseph Priestley, because it was used to rub out marks. The first patent on an integral pencil and eraser was assigned in the United States on March 30, 1858, to Joseph Reckendorfer of New York City for an invention by Hymen L. Lipman of Philadelphia, who devised a method for enlarging the groove in the pencil sheath intended for the lead core so that it would accept an eraser. In modern pencils an eraser plug is glued onto the end of a finished pencil and crimped in place by a thin metal strip, or ferrule.
